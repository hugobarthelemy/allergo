 Hi there,

 Allergo Scan is a web app aiming to help you checking the products you can eat based on your food allergies.

  The app is currently in beta.

 For now, please access the app on an Android device using the Firefox browser to fully benefit from the scanning experience.
 Scanning doesn't work on iOS for the moment.
